                                <p className="mb-6">
                                    Investigative accident intelligence supplements official accident reports with additional insights gathered through lawful and compliant investigative methods. This is especially valuable for firms handling moderate to high volumes of collision cases where accuracy, speed, and clarity matter.
                                </p>
                                <p className="mb-6">
                                    While the exact methods vary by agency, the goal is consistent across providers: deliver verified, structured information beyond what appears in the police report.
                                </p>

                                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">Why Law Firms Use Investigative Accident Intelligence</h3>
                                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                                    <li>To obtain accurate information earlier in the case lifecycle</li>
                                    <li>To validate or challenge client accounts during intake</li>
                                    <li>To understand collisions more clearly before contacting insurers</li>
                                    <li>To identify high value cases faster</li>
                                    <li>To gain clarity when official reports are incomplete</li>
                                    <li>To support liability arguments with structured supporting details</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p className="mb-6">

                                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">The Limitations of Standard Police Reports</h3>
                                <p className="mb-6">
                                    Officers often work under time pressure and challenging scene conditions. Reports may be accurate but incomplete. Common issues include:
                                </p>
                                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">

                                    Investigative intelligence fills these gaps with structured supplemental information.

                                    Intake decisions often determine the financial health of a personal injury docket. Investigative intelligence helps intake teams:

                                    <li>Identify serious collisions with clear causation</li>
                                    <li>Spot inconsistencies early</li>
                                    <li>Prioritize cases more likely to produce strong outcomes</li>

                                    This leads to a more selective and strategic intake process.

                                <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mb-3">Is investigative intelligence the same as crash reconstruction</h4>
                                <p className="mb-6">
                                    No. Crash reconstruction is an expert analysis. Investigative intelligence provides supplemental facts, not expert opinions.
                                </p>

                                <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mb-3">Can investigative intelligence replace the police report</h4>
                                <p className="mb-6">
                                    No. It supplements the police report by adding clarity and filling gaps.
                                </p>

                                <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mb-3">Is this data permissible for attorneys</h4>
                                <p className="mb-6">
                                    Yes, when used under permissible purposes such as investigation in anticipation of litigation.
                                </p>

                                <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mb-3">Does every case need investigative intelligence</h4>
                                <p className="mb-6">
                                    Not necessarily. It is most valuable when liability is unclear or reports are incomplete.
